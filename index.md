Utility and Wildfire Risks Detected From Street View Imagery with Phi Nguyen
1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\
An interesting topic covered in my domain is how utility poles, specifically the poles under SDGE, can be a major risk to public safety and quality of living for residents in San Diego. I found this interesting because it gave me a new perspective on how many regulations SDGE has to follow in order to prevent any risks. This includes maintaing the surrounding areas such as trees so that nothing touches the poles and mainting the poles itself on a regular basis.
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project**\
A potential investigation for my Quarter 2 Project would be using computer vision to monitor these utility assets in real time to detect changes in the environment, the poles itself, or any other abnormal conditions that may induce a risk.
3. **What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
A potential change I would make to the current approach is to define a clearer goal to work towards. I feel like this would help me do tasks with more urgency and it would give more purpose into why I'm completing certain tasks.
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
Other techniques I would be interested in using would be predictive modeling to predict if there will be certain risks in the near future.
